# Programming-for-Analytics-Final-Project

This repository contains the R markdown of my final project for my Programming for Analytics graduate course at UNCW. I was tasked with analyzing trends and insights surrounding the housing market in Wake County, NC throughout the past decade (at the time, this would have been from 2013-2023). The raw data this code uses for import can be provided by request.
